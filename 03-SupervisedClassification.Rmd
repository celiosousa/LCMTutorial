# Supervised Classification of Landsat 8 OLI Imagery

Objectives:

- Use the cloud-masking function (See Chapter 2's [Cloud and cloud shadow masking] section) to mask clouds on Landsat 8 Imagery;
- To produce a cloud-free composite mosaic using the median reducer ([Compositing]), and;
- To classify the cloud-free composite mosaic of Landsat 8 scenes using Random Forest.

## Example 1: Land cover classification of Greater Cairo and Giza area, Egypt - Year 2018

We will start by [*opening a new code editor page*](https://code.earthengine.google.com/){target="_blank"}

###	Temporal and spatial parameters for compositing
In this example, we are going to create a 2020 annual composite. For this, letâ€™s create three objects `(var)`: `year`, `startDay` and `endDay`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
var year = 2020; //# Year
var startDay = (year)+'-01-01'; //# beginning of date filter | month-day
var endDay = (year)+'-12-30'; //# end of date filter | month-day
```

Additionally, We need to define an area of interest for the composite. Google Earth Engine allows you to import your own shapefiles of your area of interest (through the *New* button in the Assets tab) as well as to direcly create your geometry in the code editor.
