## Introduction to Ecosystem Extent Account

This section introduces the structure of the SEEA extent account and how it is derived. The account compilation process will be demonstrated through a simple exercise.

### Essentials

**A) Projections**

## Compiling Ecosystem Extent Account Tables

This section demonstrates the process of deriving ecosystem extent accounts using scripts developed in GEE Python Colab and/or Jupyter Notebook for ArcGIS Pro.

### Essentials

**A) GEE Python Colab** Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface (API) Colab, or "Colaboratory" is a web-based interactive development environment that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser with Zero configuration required, and an access to graphics processing units (GPU) free of charge.

It can be accessed here: <https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/earthengine-api/blob/master/python/examples/ipynb/ee-api-colab-setup.ipynb>

**B) Jupyter Notebook** Jupyter Notebook is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

It can be accessed here: <https://jupyter.org/>

## Compiling Ecosystem Extent Account Tables

This section explores the use of Microsoft Excel to do basic data analytics using information from ecosystem extent accounts.

### Essentials

**A) Macros** If you have tasks in Microsoft Excel that you do repeatedly, you can record a macro to automate those tasks. A macro is an action or a set of actions that you can run as many times as you want. When you create a macro, you are recording your mouse clicks and keystrokes.
