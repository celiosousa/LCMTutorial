Some of its early definitions include: [...] the art or science of telling something about an object without touching it .(Fischer et al., 1976) Remote sensing is the acquisition of physical data of an object without touch or contact. (Lintz and Simonett, 1976) Remote sensing is the observation of a target by a device separated from it by some distance. (Barrett and Curtis, 1976) The term remote sensing in its broadest sense means &quot;reconnaissance at a distance.&quot; (Colwell, 1966) Thus, in the context of this training, we can define Remote Sensing as the science of acquiring information about a given target, object or phenomenon on the surface of the Earth by sensors on-board various platforms orbiting our planet. Building blocks of a remote sensing system Although the many different methods for collection, processing and interpretation of remotely sense data can vary widely, they will always have the following essential components: B.1) References 1.1.2 Google Earth Engine API and Java Script 1.1.3 Exploring Image and Image Collection 1.2 Image Manipulation 1.2.1 Band Math and VI Calculation 1.2.2 Thresholds and Masks "],["part-2-advanced-google-earth-engine.html", "Chapter 2 Part 2 - Advanced Google Earth Engine 2.1 Advanced Image Manipulation: Pre-classification 2.2 Supervised Classification: Random Forest 2.3 Post-classification processing", " Chapter 2 Part 2 - Advanced Google Earth Engine 2.1 Advanced Image Manipulation: Pre-classification 2.1.1 Cloud and cloud shadow masking Section Snapshot at GEE This section demonstrates a way of masking clouds and cloud shadow pixels from Landsat 8/7 Surface Reflectance data based on file metadata. This function was created based on the documentation available for Landsat 8/7. Values for pixel bit and pixel band were found here. The cloud masking function is as follows: function maskL8sr(image) { // #Bits 3 and 5 are cloud shadow and cloud, respectively. var cloudShadowBitMask = ee.Number(2).pow(3).int(); var cloudsBitMask = ee.Number(2).pow(5).int(); // #Get the pixel QA band. var qa = image.select(&#39;pixel_qa&#39;); // #Both flags should be set to zero, indicating clear conditions. var mask = qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudShadowBitMask).eq(0) .and(qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudsBitMask).eq(0)); // #Return the masked image, scaled to [0, 1]. return image.updateMask(mask).divide(10000).copyProperties(image, [&quot;system:time_start&quot;]); }; 2.1.2 Spectral indices 2.1.3 Compositing 2.2 Supervised Classification: Random Forest 2.2.1 Land-cover classification using Random Forest 2.2.2 Map-to-Map Change 2.3 Post-classification processing 2.3.1 Re-classification 2.3.2 Map spatial smoothing "],["part-3-country-specific-applications.html", "Chapter 3 PART 3 - Country-specific Applications 3.1 Liberia 3.2 Guinea", " Chapter 3 PART 3 - Country-specific Applications 3.1 Liberia 3.1.1 Class-by-class land cover mapping 3.1.2 Multi-class land cover mapping 3.1.3 Land cover to ecosystems: a map merging approach 3.2 Guinea 3.2.1 Mangrove mapping in Guinea, West Africa "]]
