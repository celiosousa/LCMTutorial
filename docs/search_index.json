Some of its early definitions include: [...] the art or science of telling something about an object without touching it .(Fischer et al., 1976) Remote sensing is the acquisition of physical data of an object without touch or contact. (Lintz and Simonett, 1976) Remote sensing is the observation of a target by a device separated from it by some distance. (Barrett and Curtis, 1976) The term remote sensing in its broadest sense means &quot;reconnaissance at a distance.&quot; (Colwell, 1966) Thus, in the context of this training, we can define Remote Sensing as the science of acquiring information about a given target, object or phenomenon on the surface of the Earth by sensors on-board various platforms orbiting our planet. B) Building blocks of remote sensing Although the many different methods for collection, processing and interpretation of remotely sense data can vary widely, they will always have the following essential components: Figure 1.1: Basic components of a remote sensing system. Energy Source The source of the electromagnetic radiation/energy (EMR) is the first requirement of any remote sensing process. The electromagnetic spectrum is used to &quot;classify&quot; the EMR according to to its wavelength: Figure 1.2: The Electromagnetic Spectrum Depending on the source of energy they are using, the different remote sensing systems can be classified as active or passive. Active sensors will produce its own source of energy for the illumination of the target. They will emit the energy toward the target being investigated and the energy reflected by this target is detected and measured by the sensor. Usually, these sensors operate in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum. On the other hand, passive sensors only measures the energy that is naturally available, usually from the sun. These sensors can only be used to detect the energy being reflected during the time when the sun is illuminating the Earth. These sensors usually measure energy from the optical range (visible, near infrared, short-wave infrared and thermal infrared). Figure 1.3: Remote sensing can be classified as Passive or Active based on the source of energy. You can also think about these concepts of active and passive using a handheld photogarphic camera as an example: When photographing a target in the dark, the camera flash will provide the energy necessary to illuminate the target. Therefore, in that case, the camera is an active sensor. On the other hand, this same camera will be a passive sensor when you are photographing a target or object during the day, when the target being illuminated by sun light and no flash is necessary. Interaction with the target/object The most common medium in between the source and target is the atmosphere. This is where the firt interaction ocurrs. As the EMR travel from its source to the target, it will come in contact with and interact different atmosphere constituents: aerosols, water vapor, solid particles, ect. Secondly, once the EMR makes its way through the atmospherethe to the target, it will interact with it depending on the target properties and energy wavelength. The EMR can have different types of interaction when it encounters matter; whether it is gas, solid or gas: it can be transmitted (that is, it passes through the target), absorbed (that is, the target absorbs the energy usually increasing its temperature as a result), emitted (that is, energy is emitted from all matter at temperatures above the absolute zero of 0 Kelvins), scattered (that is, deflected in every direction) and reflected (that is, energy bounces off the target's surface and its direction is usually a function of target structure and texture). Keep in mind: All targets can show different proportions of each of these interactions. Recording of the energy by the sensor The sensor - often onboard of airplanes or satellites in space - will measure the returning EMR after it has interacted with the target and the atmosphere. This measurement is converted into a digital image with discrete values in units of digital number (DN) for each image pixel. Depending on the sensor, these resulting images will have different characteristiscs (or resolutions). They are: Spatial Resolution: usually known as &quot;pixel size&quot;. It refers to the sensor's ability to discriminate different objects/targets. A higher spatial resolution means a smaller pixel size which, in turn, means that smaller objects can be distinguishable as separate targets. Spectral Resolution: Different sensors will measure the EMR at specific ranges (or wavelengths), usually called bands. Thus, the spectral resolution of a sensor usually refers to the number and bandwith of these bands. Radiometric Resolution: Usually measured in bits, it refers to the sensor's ability to detect the smallest change in the spectral reflectance among different targets. For example, a 8-bit image will have 256 levels of brightness while a 16-bit image has 65,536 levels of brightness. Temporal resolution (sensors onboard satellites): is the time required for the satellite to collect two images at the same geographic location on Earth. Higher temporal resolution means less time for revisiting the same location. However, temporal resolution is usually inverselly proportional to spatial resolution: The larger the pixel size, the larger area the sensor will cover which means less time until the next revisit. Transmission, Reception, and Processing The EMR recorded by the sensor is transmitted in an electronic form to a receiving station on Earth where the data is processed and stored. Analysis and Interpretation (we are here!) This is where this training is focused on! The EMR was transformed into a digital dataset where we can use specialized instruments/hardware/software to extract information about the target observed. This extraction is often done through image processing (or digital image processing), which is the process which makes an image interpretable for a given use. There are many methods of image processing, but these are the most common ones: Image correction: The digital image recorded by the sensor on a satellite (or aircraft) may contain errors related to the geometry and brightness values of the pixels. For example, a geometrical correction, also called geo-referencing, is a procedure where the content of image will be assigned a spatial coordinate system (for example, geographical latitude and longitude). Image enhancement: This is related to modification of an image, by changing the pixel brightness values, to improve its visual aspects so that the actual analysis of images will be easier, faster and more reliable. Image classification: The overall goal of this method is to categorize all pixels in an image into themes (or land cover classes). This resulting map with its limited number of classes can be more readily and sucessfully interpreted compared to the raw image and it is often use for planning purposes. There are supervised and unsupervised methods for classification of an image: A supervised classification (human-guided) is based on the idea that a user can select sample pixels in an image that are representative of specific classes and then direct the image processing software to use these training sites as references for the classification of all other pixels in the image. These samples are selected based on the knowledge of the user. On the other hand, an unsupervised classification (computer/software-guided) is where the output classes are based on the software's ability to determine which pixels are related, using several different models and techniques. This final component of Remote Sensing (V) is achieved when we apply the extracted information to solve a particular problem. C) Spectral Signatures: A target's spectral fingerprint As mentioned before, remote sensing is based on the measurement of reflected (or emitted) radiation from different targets. Objects having different surface features reflect or absorb the sun's radiation in different ways. In order to understand and interprete the information extracted from remotely sensed data, you have to first understand the behavior of the target in respect to the electromagnetic spectrum. Each target will show a distinct reflectance pattern as a function of the wavelength - known as spectral signature (or a spectral fingerprint). This signature will directly (or indirectly) lead to the identification of a target based on its set of values for its reflectance in different spectral ranges: Figure 1.4: Typical spectral signatures of specic land cover types in the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Source: http://www.seos-project.eu/) Reflectance is the ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking the target. It has no units. The spectral signature of healthy green vegetation has a small reflectance in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum resulting from the pigments in plant leaves. Most of the light is being used in the photosynthesis process. However, the reflectance increases dramatically in the near infrared. The spectral signature of soil is much less variable. Its behavior is affected by soil moisture, texture, surface roughness and they are less dominant than the absorbance features present in vegetation. The water's spectral signature is characterized by a high absorption at near infrared wavelengths range and beyond. Because of this absorption property, water bodies as well as features containing water can easily be detected, located and delineated with remote sensing data. These differences make it possible to identify different earth surface features or materials by analysing their spectral reflectance patterns or spectral signatures.

It provides a large catalog of ready-to-use, cloud-hosted datasets. One of Earth Engine's key features is the ability to handle computationally demading processing and analysis very fast by distributing them across a large number of servers. The ability to efficiently use the cloud-hosted datasets and computation is enabled by the Earth Engine API. An API is a way to communicate with Google Earth Engine servers. It allows you to specify what computation or command you would like to do, and then to receive the results back from the servers. The API is designed so that users do not need to worry about how the computation is distributed across a cluster of machines and the results are assembled. Users of the API simply specify what needs to be done. This greatly simplifies the code by hiding the implementation detail from the users. It also makes Earth Engine simpler for users who are not too familiar with writing code. JavaScript API and Introduction to the Code Editor The Earth Engine platform comes with a web-based Code Editor that allows you to start using the Earth Engine JavaScript API without any installation. It also provides additional functionality to display your results on a map, save your scripts, access documentation, manage tasks, and more. It has a one-click mechanism to share your code with other usersallowing for easy reproducibility and collaboration. In addition, the JavaScript API comes with a user interface library, which allows you to create charts and web-based applications with little effort. The Code Editor is an integrated development environment for the Earth Engine JavaScript API. It offers an easy way to type, debug, run, and manage code. Once you have successfully registered for a Google Earth Engine account, you can visit https://code.earthengine.google.com/ to open the Code Editor. When you first visit the Code Editor, you will see a screen such as the one shown below: Figure 1.5: Earth Engine Code Editor The Code Editor allows you to type JavaScript code and execute it. When you are first learning a new language and getting used to a new programming environment, it is customary to make a program to display your name or the words Hello World. This is a fun way to start coding that shows you how to give input to the program and how to execute it. It also shows where the program displays the output. Doing this in JavaScript is quite simple. Copy the following code into the center panel: print(&#39;Hello World&#39;); The line of code above uses the JavaScript print() function to print the text Hello World to the screen. Once you enter the code, click the Run button. The output will be displayed on the upper right-hand panel under the Console tab: Figure 1.6: Running code with GEE You now know where to type your code, how to run it, and where to look for the output. You just wrote your first Earth Engine script and may want to save it. Click the Save button to save a script: Figure 1.7: Saving a script If this is your first time using the Code Editor, you will be prompted to create a home folder. This is a folder in the cloud where all your code will be saved: Figure 1.8: Your first home folder You can pick a name of your choice, but remember that it cannot be changed and will permanently be associated with your account. Once youre home folder is created, you will be prompted to create a new repository. A repository is a like a folder where you can save your scripts. You can also share entire repositories with other users. Your account can have multiple repositories and each one can hold multiple code scripts. Start by creating a repository: Figure 1.9: Your first repository Finally, you will be able to save your script inside the newly created repository. Enter a name of your choice and click OK: Spaces are not allowed when naming scripts! Figure 1.10: Saving a script file Once the script is saved, it will appear in the script manager panel. The scripts are saved in the cloud and will always be available to you when you open the Code Editor. Figure 1.11: Your first script in your repository JavaScript Basics Javascript is the language you will use to construct and set up your commands and analysis. This section covers the basics of the Java Script sintax and some basic data structures. In the following sections, more JavaScript code will be presented. Throughout this document, code will be presented with a distinct colored font and with shaded background. As you encounter code, copy and paste it into the Code Editor and click Run. A) Variables In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, a variable is defined using the var keyword followed by the name of the variable. For instance, create a var named city that contain the text string 'Monrovia'. Text strings in the code must be always in quotes. Google Earth Engine allows you to use single ' or double &quot; quotes, as long as they match in the beginning and end of the text string. We also usually end each statement on scripts with a semicolon ;, although Earth Engine's code editor does not require it. A `i' will be shown in the line of the code where a semicolon is missing: Figure 1.12: Even though they are not a requirement, Google Earth Engine indicates that a semicolon is missing in the statement. You can hover the mouse cursor over the icon to reveal its meaning. var city = &#39;Monrovia&#39;; If you print the variable city, you will get the value stored (as a string because of the quotations) stored in the variable (Monrovia) printed in the Console. print(city); When you use quotations, the variable is automatically assigned the type string. You can also assign numbers to variables. For example, create the variables population and area and assing a number as their value. When assigning numbers, you do not use commas , for thousand separators. You do, however, use . for decimals: var population = 939524; var area = 194.25; Print those variables to the Console. You can also add text to describe the variables printed in the Console. Simply add a text string within the print function along with the variable being printed separated with ,. Use the code below as example: print(&#39;Number of people in Monrovia:&#39;, population); print(area, &#39;km squared&#39;); B) Lists In the previous examples, we created variables holding a single value (text or number). JavaScript provides a data structure called a list that can be used When you want to store multiple values in a single variable. You can create lists using square brackets [] and adding multiple values separated by ,. Create a variable called listofcities, add values to it and print it to the Console: var listofcities = [&#39;Monrovia&#39;, &#39;Gbarnga&#39;,&#39;Kakata&#39;, &#39;Bensonville&#39;]; print(&#39;Largest cities in Liberia&#39;, listofcities); Looking at the output in the Console, you will see listofcities with an expander arrow () next to it. Expand the list by clicking on the arrow to show its content. You will notice that along with the items on the list, there will be a number next to each value you added. This is the index of each item. It allows you to refer to each item in the list using a numeric value that indicates its position in the list. This is useful when you want to extract a particular item from a list object. Figure 1.13: A JavaScript List. C) Objects and Dictionaries While useful to hold multiple values, lists are not appropriate to hold more structured data. JavaScript allows you to store 'key-value' information in objects or dictionaries. In this type of data structure, you can refer to a value by its key rather than its position - like in lists. You can create objects using curly braces {}. Use the code below as an example of an object: var cityData = {&#39;city&#39;: &#39;Monrovia&#39;, &#39;population&#39;: 939524, &#39;area&#39;: 194.25, &#39;coordinates&#39;: [-10.790, 6.315]}; There are a few important things about the syntax of the code above. As objects tend to hold several keys and values, it can be difficult to read the code if it is written on a continuous string. To improve readability you can use multiple lines instead: var cityData = { &#39;city&#39;: &#39;Monrovia&#39;, &#39;population&#39;: 939524, &#39;area&#39;: 194.25, &#39;coordinates&#39;: [-10.790, 6.315] }; Note how each key-value pair is on a different line. It is much easier to organize your key-value information this way. Additionally, the code can be more easily read. Second, note that the object above can holds multiple types of types of values (string and numbers) and structure (list)! If you print cityData to the Console, you can see that instead of a numeric index, each value will be identified by its key. Figure 1.14: A JavaScript Object. This key can also be used to retrieve the value of an item within an object or dictionary. If you want to retrieve a particular key from a dictionary, simply use ['key']. For example, if you want to retrieve the population value from this object and print it individually to the Console, you can use a code like this: print(cityData[&#39;population&#39;]); The same logic can be applied to lists. Always remember that lists have numeric index. Therefore, when retrieving itens from a list, use the number of its position on the list: print(listofcities[&#39;2&#39;]); D) Functions Functions are often used to group a set of operations and used to repeat the same operation with different set of parameters without having to rewrite the code for every iteration. In other words, you can call a function with different parameters to generate different outputs without changing the code. Functions are defined using function(). They often take parameters which tell the function what to do. These parameters go inside the parentheses (). Below is an example of a function named SumFunction to calculate the sum of two numbers: fistValue and secondValue. The var sum adds those two parameters and return is used to generate the output of that operation function SumFunction (firstValue, secondValue) { var sum = firstValue + secondValue; return sum; } Note that if you run the code above, nothing happens. This is just a function and it needs to be given the parameters. For example, if you need to add 37 to 584 using this function and print the result into the Console, you can use the code below: var result = SumFunction(37,584); print(result); When you call SumFunction, it will always perform the operation sum with watever two parameters you define in (). As mentioned, you can perform several operations at once using functions. For example, you can add other operations in the function above and return a list or a dictionary with the results: function MathFunction (firstValue, secondValue) { var sum = firstValue + secondValue; var sub = firstValue - secondValue; var fraction = firstValue / secondValue; return {&#39;Result Sum&#39;:sum, &#39;Result Substraction&#39;:sub, &#39;Result Division&#39;: fraction}; } Using MathFunction with a pair of parameters (firstValue and SecondValue) will return an object with the results of each operation: var results = MathFunction(500,5); print(results); Figure 1.15: Printed results of MathFunction. Earth Engine Containers and Objects So far, you learned the different data structure you can use within Google Earth Engine. However, if you want to do any computation with the data stored in these different types of structure, you will have to use an Earth Engine container. The ee package is used for formulating requests to Earth Engine. In other words, ee allows you to request Earth Engine servers to perform a certain computation to an varible or object. 1.1.3 Exploring Image and Image Collection 1.2 Image Manipulation 1.2.1 Band Math and VI Calculation 1.2.2 Thresholds and Masks "],["part-2-advanced-google-earth-engine.html", "Chapter 2 Part 2 - Advanced Google Earth Engine 2.1 Advanced Image Manipulation: Pre-classification 2.2 Supervised Classification: Random Forest 2.3 Post-classification processing", " Chapter 2 Part 2 - Advanced Google Earth Engine 2.1 Advanced Image Manipulation: Pre-classification 2.1.1 Cloud and cloud shadow masking Section Snapshot at GEE This section demonstrates a way of masking clouds and cloud shadow pixels from Landsat 8/7 Surface Reflectance data based on file metadata.
