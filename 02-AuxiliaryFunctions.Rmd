## Cloud and cloud shadow masking

This section demonstrates a way of masking clouds and cloud shadow pixels from Landsat 8/7 Surface Reflectance data based on file metadata. This function was created based on the documentation available for Landsat 8/7. Values for pixel bit and pixel band were found here: [https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-1-level-1-quality-assessment-band?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con]{target="_blank"}

Then use this function
