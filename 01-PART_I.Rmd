# Part 1 - Basics & Fundamentals

## Programming and Remote Sensing Basics 

### Remote Sensing Language

__A) Definition__

The term *__Remote sensing__* has been variously defined. Some of its early definitions include:

- [...] the art or science of telling something about an object without touching it .(Fischer et al., 1976)

- Remote sensing is the acquisition of physical data of an object without touch or contact. (Lintz and Simonett, 1976)

- Remote sensing is the observation of a target by a device separated from it by some distance. (Barrett and Curtis, 1976)

- The term _remote sensing_ in its broadest sense means "reconnaissance at a distance." (Colwell, 1966)

Thus, in the context of this training, we can define *Remote Sensing* as the science of acquiring information about a given target, object or phenomenon on the surface of the Earth by sensors on-board various platforms orbiting our planet. 

__B) Building blocks of a remote sensing system__

Although the many different methods for collection, processing and interpretation of remotely sense data can vary widely, they will always have the following essential components:

```

- Energy Source

- Interaction with the target/oject

- Recording of the energy by the sensor

- Transmission, Reception, and Processing

- Analysis and Interpretation (we are here!)
